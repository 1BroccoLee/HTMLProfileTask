    <p>Im 37 years old and dont believe im too old to try new things.
        My deepest passion is cycling one of my current weekly cyling goals is to ride a minimum of 110km a week with the aim of riding 5000km this year. At the moment ia am on track to exceed my goals

        I am learning digital skill this year so I can find new employment in the tech sector.
        I want to work in the tech sector as i want a new challenge and i feel the work will be similar to a previous career as a bicycle mechanic, where i was salving problems daily with technical skills and creativity.

        I finished highschool in 2002 with mostly B and C grades I completed a single year of college before entering full time work in retail, from there i joned the army and shortly after entered the cycling trade due to medical discharge from the army. after almost 10 year in the cycling industry I went travelling after 3 years overseas I found myself living and working in Lancaster Uk where I have been for 5 years working in adminstration and operations tasks. It is a job where i dont really feel challenged anymore and i need a new challenge.

        I have good problem solving skills able to assess the relavent information to make a decision on moving forward. even if the decision turns out not to be the best, I am able to justify it.
        I can also be very creative in my solutions looking at everything beyond its original intention.
        Despite describing myself as an introvert i seem to do quite well in group settings and in networking meetings.
        I can also eat an unusually large amount of food thanks to my cycling
